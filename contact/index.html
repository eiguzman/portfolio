    <p1>Bee Movie
        By Jerry Seinfeld
        
        NARRATOR:
        (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard)
        According to all known laws
        of aviation,
         :
        there is no way a bee
        should be able to fly.
         :
        Its wings are too small to get
        its fat little body off the ground.
         :
        The bee, of course, flies anyway
         :
        because bees don't care
        what humans think is impossible.
        BARRY BENSON:
        (Barry is picking out a shirt)
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
        Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
         :
        Ooh, black and yellow!
        Let's shake it up a little.</p1>
